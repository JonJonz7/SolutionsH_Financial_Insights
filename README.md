# 💼 Dashboard | SolutionsH Healthcare

## 📊 Executive Summary

This project was commissioned by **SolutionsH**, a mid-sized healthcare provider operating across 4 regional markets with 8 clinical departments, including Emergency, Cardiology, Pediatrics, and Oncology. The CFO and finance leadership team engaged me to deliver an automated, executive-facing dashboard that would provide clear visibility into:

- Budget vs. actual performance across departments and regions  
- Monthly revenue and expense trends with volatility tracking  
- Accounts Receivable (AR) and Payable (AP) risk exposure  
- Cash runway and liquidity thresholds for operational planning  

Working with a 24-month export of structured financial data from the client’s internal warehouse, I engineered a complete financial insights solution using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** — optimized for board-level reporting, strategic planning, and operational decision-making.

> 🧠 **Outcome:** The dashboard uncovered performance inefficiencies, cash flow timing risks, and a 3x industry-standard cash runway — enabling finance leadership to improve forecasting models and redeploy underutilized reserves into high-return strategic initiatives.

## 🎯 Objective

Design and deliver a financial dashboard that simplifies complex financial data into clear, visual KPIs — allowing leadership to:
- Track performance vs. budget in real-time  
- Assess operational health through cash runway and profit metrics  
- Identify risk exposures in AR/AP cycles  
- Guide capital allocation with confidence

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python** – Data cleaning, KPI engineering, trend analysis, forecasting
- **Pandas / NumPy / Seaborn / Matplotlib** – Exploratory and financial data analysis
- **Power BI** – Executive dashboard with dynamic visualizations
- **SQL** – Data aggregation, metric queries, and pipeline simulation

## ❓ Key Business Questions Solved

1. **Are we staying within budget across departments and regions?**  
2. **What are the trends in revenue, expenses, and profit volatility over time?**  
3. **Are our AR and AP levels creating cash flow risks?**  
4. **How long can we operate with our current cash if revenue stopped? (Cash Runway)**

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Cardiology and Radiology consistently outperform budget — may warrant budget realignment.
- Revenue is stable, but profit swings by over $2M/month — introducing risk to cash planning.
- AR-to-revenue ratios in Oncology and Orthopedics suggest payer or billing lag issues.
- Average cash runway exceeds 200 days — over 3x industry standard — providing a strategic liquidity buffer.

## 📂 Data Source & Methodology

This analysis was conducted using proprietary financial data provided by **SolutionsH**. The dataset included:

- Monthly revenue, expenses, and budget allocations  
- Department-level cash positions and burn rates  
- Outstanding Accounts Receivable (AR) and Payable (AP)  
- Patient volume and encounter-level summaries (de-identified)  

The data spanned **January 2022 to December 2023**, totaling over **20,000 financial records** across departments and regions. All data was extracted from the client’s internal systems and exported in Excel/CSV format for analysis.

> 🔐 **Compliance Note**: All patient-level data was pre-aggregated and de-identified by the client’s internal team to ensure full compliance with HIPAA and internal data governance policies.

The metrics presented — including budget variance, profit margins, AR/AP exposure, and cash runway — reflect actual operational performance trends and were used to advise finance leadership on forecasting, liquidity planning, and departmental decision-making.
